# pilaf

A collection of extensions and utilities for [Sql Korma](http://sqlkorma.com/) that we found we were rewriting for every project.

## Usage

### defentity+

Adds the following conveniences to defentity.

#### field-transforms
Apply field-level, two-way transformations for individual fields in a table.  This can already be done using (transform) and (prepare), however the use of field-transforms factors away a bit of the boilerplate thats required.

```
